## Author Management

Description: I want to be able to view all of the authors that I've added via the papers interface. I want to scroll through them alphabetically by default. I want to be able to merge them via an interface accessible from the authors page.

Views:
  - Show/Manage authors
    - Link to merge authors at the top of the page
    - Merge interface shows checkboxes in front of all names
    - Large arrow should show at the right-hand side of the screen to go to confirm page, once authors are checked
  - Merge Confirm page
    - Shows the brief description of each paper author (co-)wrote in a small window
    - Links / Buttons at bottom to confirm/deny merge
